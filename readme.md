PRACTICE CHALLENGE

My first boilerplate (from Fullstack) was not working properly, so I used one I had made without any connected database. Because of this, I had to troubleshoot a bit attaching a database.

I created database with associations and a small seed file that works when running 'node seed'

I created a react component with a form to submit a new tool

I created an API route to post a new tool, which updates the database
